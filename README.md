**Description**

- The purpose of this repository is to have a place to store algorithms I have used for my own learning and understanding. Below you will find a list of them in the order I completed them.

**Test Driven Development**

- In each of the algorithms I include an index.spec.js file that I used to test alogithms using the npm test command. 
- The purpose of this is to write code more efficiently and find problems sooner rather than later in the development process.

**Algorithm Library**
1. Average Word Length
2. Find Longest Word
3. Total Word Length
